            </h2>
            <p>
              When choosing service providers, Glovo may transfer your data
              outside the borders of the European Economic Area, for example to
              the United States. In such cases, Glovo will ensure before sending
              the data, that such service providers are in compliance with the
              standard clauses and minimum security standards established by the
              European Commission and that they always process the data in
              accordance with Glovo’s instructions.

              Basis and instructions regarding the international transfer
            </h3>
            <p>
              Glovo may have a contractual relationship with service providers
              under which they agree to comply with Glovo’s instructions and put
              in place the necessary security measures to protect your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where Glovo is compelled to carry out further processing by EU law
              or the law of the EU Member States to which it is subject, it
              shall inform the service provider of such legal requirements prior
              to the processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Glovo may subsequently change, supplement or replace the
              instructions initially given to the service provider by means of
              individual instructions and is entitled to issue appropriate
              instructions at any time. This includes, among other things,
              instructions regarding the correction, deletion and prohibition of
              data. All instructions issued shall be documented by both Glovo
              and the service provider.

              Requirements directed to service providers
            </h3>
            <p>
              Service providers may only collect, process or use data pursuant
              to a master contract and in accordance with Glovo’s instructions.
              This applies in particular to the transfer of personal data to a
              third country or an international organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              External service providers are required to inform Glovo if they
              consider that an instruction issued by Glovo, is in contravention
              of the data protection legislation. Furthermore, service providers
              are entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction concerned
              until its confirmation or modification by Glovo, and they have a
              duty to refuse to carry out any instructions that are clearly
              illegal.

              Glovo does not adopt any decision that could affect our User/
              Courier / Job Applicant significantly based solely on automated
              processing of their data (e.g. reordering from the stores where
              our Users have ordered in the past). The only decision-making
              processes of Glovo are conducted by applying human intervention

              considered for an offer, such as location).
